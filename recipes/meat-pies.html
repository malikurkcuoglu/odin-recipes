    <h2>Meat Pies Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Meat pies are one of the first things I learned how to make in Home
      Economics class in secondary schoolâ€“shortcrust pastry, filled with a
      minced meat mixture that had potatoes and carrots too. I remember this
      being a big deal because at the time, meat pies were some of the
      quintessential fast food treats offered at quick service restaurants, and
      my parents did not give us fast food often. The ability to make them at
      home was a very big deal to me. With the holidays around the corner,
      homemade meat pies with buttery crusts and lush meat filling are the
      perfect snack.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup cold salted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons water, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds ground meat</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 carrot, peeled and diced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried mixed herbs</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift flour into a bowl. Add chunks of cold butter. Use fingers to rub
        butter into flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add water, a
        tablespoon at a time, until a non-sticky dough forms. Wrap dough in
        plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, add meat,
        onions, garlic, and carrots, and cook, stirring constantly, until meat
        is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add white pepper, curry powder, thyme, and mixed herbs, and mix well;
        cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Season
        to taste with salt. Remove from heat; set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a well-floured surface, roll dough out about 1/4-inch thick, and cut
        out circles using a cookie cutter, cup, or bowl in a size you are happy
        with. Place some filling in the center of the pastry circle and fold
        over carefully. Press the edges of the pastry firmly together with a
        fork to seal. Re-roll dough scraps, and repeat until pastry and meat
        filling are used up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place pies on the prepared baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, brush the
        formed pies with beaten egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is
        hot, about 15 minutes. Enjoy!
